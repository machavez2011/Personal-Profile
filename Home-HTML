    Hello! Thank you for taking the time to visit my site. My name is Michael Chavez and I am a business manager, photographer, and aspiring web developer. I have created this web page as a way to showcase some of the work I have done and to give you a better look into my life up to this point.
    </p>
    
    <p style="top: 258px;">
    Currently, I am a Manager at    
    <a href="http://www.prodogwalkingservice.com/" id="PDWS" target="_blank">
    Professional Dog Walking Service,
    </a>
    where I am responsible for managing employee payroll, client invoicing, maintaing the website, and of course... walking dogs. But really? I help manage a group of walkers who provide dogs that would normally be cooped up at home all day, a way to release energy and do their business so that they are happy before their owners come home from work.
    </p>
    
    <p style="top: 475px;">
    I recently stumbled upon web development when helping to maintain the website at Professional Dog Walking Service and quickly realized that I really enjoy coding. I hope to one day be able to combine this skill set with my love of photograhy to make beautiful webistes for many people to enjoy. I welcome you to continue browsing through my website to see what I have to offer.
    </p>
